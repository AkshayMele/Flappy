# Flappy Bird Game in Python using Pygame

![Flappy Bird](assets/Flappy.png)

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Python and the Pygame library. The game features a bird that the player can control to navigate through pipes while avoiding collisions with the ground and pipes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AkshayMele/Flappy.git
   
2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   
3. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python flappy.py

### 8.Build Management

Using Pybuilder to build the Project which enables us to install and import as a package for usage in other projects

â†’ With Pybuilder: Find files [here](https://github.com/AkshayMele/Flappy/tree/main/target)

### 9. Unit tests

I have conducted 3 unit tets each of them testing different fucntionalities of the code
+ [Test bird movement](https://github.com/AkshayMele/Flappy/blob/main/tests/test_bird.py)
+ [Test collision detection](https://github.com/AkshayMele/Flappy/blob/main/tests/test_collision_detection.py)
+ [Test pipe spawning](https://github.com/AkshayMele/Flappy/blob/main/tests/test_pipe.py)
+
